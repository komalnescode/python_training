            <h3>Python</h3>  <hr/>
            <p> Python is a General Purpose, Interpreter based, and Object-oriented Programming Language. It is a language that is remarkably easy to learn, and it can be used as a stepping stone into other programming languages and frameworks. If you're an absolute beginner and this is your first time working with any type of coding language, that's something you definitely want and we WebCreintors are here to lift you from basic to multifarious.

            <p> Django is a high-level Python framework. It is free and open-source, written in Python itself, and follows the model-view-template architectural pattern. We can use it to develop quality web applications faster and easier. Since developing for the web needs a set of similar components, you can use a framework. This way, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. These tasks include authentication, forms, uploading files, management panels, and so.
